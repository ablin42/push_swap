# push_swap
### This is the push_swap project done @ 42 Paris

This project require us to sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, with as little move as it takes.
To validate the project, we have to handle multiple sorting algorithms and chose which solution is the best for an optimized sorting of the data.

### Objectives
> - Sorting algorithms
> - Stack notions

### Skills
> - Rigor
> - Imperative programming
> - Algorithms & AI
> - Unix
